# Environmental-Performance-and-Earnings-Management
This repository contains an empirical research project examining the relationship between environmental performance and earnings management practices. The analysis focuses on Russian companies in the oil and gas, mining and metallurgy, and energy industries over the period 2018–2020.

The study combines environmental performance data from the WWF-Russia Environmental Openness Rating with financial information from the SPARK database and corporate governance data from firms’ annual reports. Panel data methods, including pooled and fixed-effects models, are used to estimate accrual-based and real earnings management measures.

The results suggest a positive association between environmental performance and accrual-based earnings management, and a negative association with real earnings management.
